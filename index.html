        <h3>The SOLID Principles of Software Design by Examples</h3>

        <p>
          SOLID is an acronym for five principles that help software
          developers design maintainable and extendable classes. It stands for
          Single responsibility, Open-closed, Liskov substitution, Interface
          segregation and Dependency inversion. The acronym was first
          introduced by Michael Feathers and is based on Uncle Bob’s paper
          Design Principles and Design Patterns.

          This blog will be directed to IFI Solution, Top 10 IT enterprises in
          Vietnam 2020. We also took a look at the company's website, and
          found that fun activities or company bondings' news are rarely
          mentioned here. Therefore, the expected results of my group's
          project is a suggestion to help the company promote the company's
          culture and working environment with a separate "Blogs" section with
          a "News" section.

          The final outcome of this project is to form a website that helps
          school administrators and teachers manage students in an effective
          and convenient manner. Furthermore, the website is designed with a
          stunning interface, but it still ensures provision of fundamental
          administrative tools such as news, marks, feedback and so on

          Organizations currently leverage music classification to make
          suggestions to their consumers (e.g Spotify, Soundcloud) or simply
          as a commodity (e.g iTunes, Shazam). The first step in that
          direction is to identify music genres. Our orientation in the
          notebook is to carry out comprehensive examination of sound
          including how to visualize, classify and eventually comprehend it
